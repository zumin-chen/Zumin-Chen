<h2>Research Interests</h2>
  <p>Broadly, I am interested in understanding children's brain and behavioral developmental trajectories through 
   neuroimaging, phenotyping, and psychological measures. I believe that to gain a comprehensive understanding of 
   child development, it is essential to study the influence of environments and contexts. Longitudinal study designs 
   are crucial in capturing these developmental changes over time, and I hope one day I will be able to follow children's 
    development from the prenatal stage onwards to better understand the earliest factors that 
    influence developmental trajectories.</p>

  
  <p>My motivation stems from a desire to identify neural and behavioral biomarkers associated with developmental disabilities 
     and evaluate the efficacy of early childhood interventions. I believe that this line of research has the potential to 
    develop effective screening and prevention tools for children with learning differences, enabling earlier access to critical services 
     and significantly improving developmental outcomes. Moreover, by advancing these research efforts, I aim to foster 
     stronger communication between researchers, parents, educators, and policymakers. This collaboration is essential in 
     shaping equitable educational policies and ensuring that every child has access to the support they need for 
     academic success.</p>
